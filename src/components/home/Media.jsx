                    When I was a student in my first year at University, my classes bore me. 
                    I wanted to learn how to make money to get paid to go to the classes I didn’t like.
                    Like everyone that has seen <i>The Wolf</i>...

                    Recently, I’ve taken up uploading videos to YouTube that combine various passions of mine including: 
                    coding and comedy. I’ve been trying to decide what kind of camera I want to get, and while it may 
                    not be an urgent problem to solve, I ended up researching cameras for longer than I’d like to admit.
                    <p></p>
                    While researching, I had an idea to build a camera. I had built a computer many times before, so I 
                    figured why not look into it...
